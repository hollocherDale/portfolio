  <p>LittleBoxes is galery application for sharing Docker containers. <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a> is a popular emerging virtualization technology. It is used in a variety of contexts such as deploying development environments, or deplying platforms as a service. LittleBoxes is an engaging atmosphere for discussing and sharing dockers.

  <p>The user model is backed by devise and presently employs github authorization to join. This was a logical choice since the docker community is prevalent on github. Each user has a profile page for displaying their social media information as well as all containers they own. Each container has a dedicated page for showing the container and owner's information. Commenting is allowed and localized to each container page.</p>

  <p>Dandelion, my personal project, is a portal for users to engage in choose your own adventures and then extend them as a community. Users can submit additional paths to the story that are voted on and published on a daily basis. As stories are added, the adventure becomes bigger and bigger!</p>
  <p>Dandelion users a state machine to manage the publicatio cycle of all submissions. The top two voted submissions at each path become added in as new adventures while the remaining submissions are archived. These tasks are handled by a cron job, recurring on a daily and weekly basis.
