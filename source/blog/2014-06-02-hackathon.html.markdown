Highlights:

Working on an experienced team in a two day sprint.

Meeting a unique slice of programmers in the Portland area, not just rubyists.

Seeing how people used programming to accomplish interesting problems.

My goal of using rails in a competent team were fulfilled. I leanred that scaffolding is useful, HAML is better, and kill feature creep. As a team, we continually evaluated what we were doing this weekend in terms of what would be a complete user experience, and what would be possible within our time limit.</p>

Our team was pioneered by [Alan Williams](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/author/alanw/), [Jeremy Monetau](https://github.com/jmoe) and Ryan Branciforte. Jeremy and Ryan are CTO and CEO of [trailhead labs](http://www.trailheadlabs.com/), a Bay area start up working with parks and recs. The PLATS mission arose from working with them in an attempt to provide a accesible format for use across the country.

Public Land And Trail Specification

Team PLATS worked on [trailedit](http://trailheadit.trailheadlabs.com/trailheads) a simple app for documenting trailheads and the available amenities there.
