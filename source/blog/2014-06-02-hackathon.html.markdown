<h2>Highlights:</h2>
  <ul><strong> 
    <li>Working on an experienced team in a two day sprint.</li>
    <li>Meeting a unique slice of programmers in the Portland area, not just rubyists.</li>
    <li>Seeing how people used programming to accomplish interesting problems.</li>
  </strong></ul>
<p>My goal of using rails in a competent team were fulfilled. I leanred that scaffolding is useful, HAML is better, and kill feature creep. As a team, we continually evaluated what we were doing this weekend in terms of what would be a complete user experience, and what would be possible within our time limit.</p>
<p>Our team was pioneered by <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/author/alanw/">Alan Williams</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jmoe">Jeremy Monteau</a>, and Ryan Branciforte. Jeremy and Ryan are CTO and CEO of <a href="http://www.trailheadlabs.com/">trailhead labs</a>, a Bay area start up working with parks and recs. The PLATS mission arose from working with them in an attempt to provide a accesible format for use across the country.
<h2>Public Land And Trail Specification</h2>
<p>Team PLATS worked on <a href="http://trailheadit.trailheadlabs.com/trailheads">trailedit</a>, a simple app for documenting trailheads and the available amenities there.
