- **Work with experienced team in a two day sprint.**
- **Meet unique slice of programmers in the Portland area**
- **See people use programming to accomplish complex problems.**

My goal of using rails in a competent team were fulfilled. I learned that scaffolding is useful, HAML is better, and kill feature creep. As a team, we continually evaluated what we were doing this weekend in terms of what would be a complete user experience, and what would be possible within our time limit.

Our team was pioneered by [Alan Williams](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/author/alanw/), [Jeremy Monetau](https://github.com/jmoe) and Ryan Branciforte. Jeremy and Ryan are CTO and CEO of [trailhead labs](http://www.trailheadlabs.com/), a Bay area start up working with parks and recs. The PLATS mission arose from working with them in an attempt to provide a accesible format for use across the country.

### Public Land And Trail Specification (PLATS)

Team PLATS worked on [trailedit](http://trailheadit.trailheadlabs.com/trailheads) a simple app for documenting trailheads and the available amenities there.
